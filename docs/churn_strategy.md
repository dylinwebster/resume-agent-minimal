## Twilio Segment: Strategic Renewal Recovery

**SITUATION:**  
When I joined Twilio Segment, gross renewal rates had fallen to 71% and continued to decline. This was causing net revenue contraction and instability.

**ACTION:**  
- Identified lack of post-sale charter, ownership, and strategic clarity as root causes.
- Established key workstreams to correct course:
  - Defined a clear RACI for CSM and Sales roles throughout the lifecycle.
  - Created a new engagement framework tailored by customer segment.
  - Built a customer journey system of record to visualize touchpoints and risk.
  - Launched enablement focused on identifying risk and executing save plays.

**RESULT:**  
- Improved CSM alignment and role clarity.
- Reduced churn and reestablished confidence in post-sales execution.
- Foundation for future GRR improvements and NRR growth.
