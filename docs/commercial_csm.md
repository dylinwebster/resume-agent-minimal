# Commercially-Minded CSMs

I partnered with sales to define expansion triggers tied to customer maturity and success milestones. Our CSMs were trained not only to retain accounts but to surface and qualify upsell opportunities through health score changes, use case expansion, and advocacy development.

This drove a revenue-aligned CS motion without turning CSMs into quota-carrying reps.
