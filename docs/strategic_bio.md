# Strategic Bio

I’m a customer-facing operator with a track record of leading post-sales organizations through growth, scale, and turnaround — often in high-growth environments where all three are in motion. My work lives at the intersection of customer experience, revenue strategy, and operational rigor.

I’ve led teams of 750+, overseen nearly $1B in customer revenue, and managed $200M+ in professional services and implementation capacity. I’ve also built teams from zero, recovered churn-heavy portfolios, and defined the CS playbook at companies working to scale their enterprise motion.

At SAP Concur, I led the global customer success, services, and support organization — responsible for retention and growth across nearly a billion in ARR. I launched a monetized TAM service that drove $65M in ARR in its first year, and redesigned our implementation model to improve productivity by 40% while decreasing time to value for our customers by 33%.

At Twilio Segment, I took on a post-sales business in need of a reset. We doubled professional services revenue, materially improved GRR, restructured CS around value delivery in the first 30 days, and simplified how the business measured success — all while aligning to a more strategic sales motion.

The throughline in my work is creating clarity — for customers, teams, and cross-functional partners. I build systems where strategy isn't something taped to the wall, but something that shows up in how people behave, prioritize, and measure. I coach leaders with a framework-first mindset, and I obsess over building durable orgs that scale beyond any one exec.

I’m particularly drawn to companies entering an inflection point — whether that’s a shift from PLG to enterprise, a need for disciplined operational scale, or a push for services profitability. I don’t chase titles, but I care deeply about outcomes — and the systems that produce them. I’m motivated by building what’s next, not protecting what exists.
