AI Ready: Yes
Actions: Commercial Realignment: Compensation and Governance

To fix broken incentive structures and restore pricing discipline, I partnered with sales leadership, our pricing team, finance, operations, and legal.

• Introduced sales compensation: I negotiated a 2% payout for sales on one-time professional services fees sold, immediately raising our hourly bookings rate 295% and achieving positive hourly margins
• Deal approval workflow: I partnered with our sales operations and finance teams to review financial health and introduce new discounting guardrails, protecting services margins

Impact: These levers allowed us to realize 23% positive hourly margins on sold revenue in their first quarter, enabling us to transform our hourly margin profile to +58% by end of 2025.

Operational Transformation: Scaled Delivery, Backlog Reform, & Improved Reporting Practices

To create sustainable delivery models and drive efficiency, I:

• Launched a professional services subscription model that:
• Shifted customer expectations from blocks of hours to outcomes-based delivery
• Improved visibility into actual work performed
• Enabled scalable service delivery with clearer engagement terms
• Addressed the legacy backlog model by reducing our 30,000-hour overhang and migrating to more predictable, time-bound workstreams
• Retired legacy SKUs that were auto-attached at 100% discount
• Partnered with finance to build new reporting excluding carved revenue, aligning recognized revenue internally to real customer value
Strategic Innovation: Launch of New Offerings

Developed tiered subscription-based offerings that allowed customers to choose from light, medium, and high-touch engagements. This model enabled a shift from hourly billed revenue to ratable revenue—improving forecasting accuracy, financial health, and customer value delivery.

Impact:

• Closed $3.84M in bookings and $1.44M in ACV in Q4 2024 from two subscription deals
• Pacing to achieve nearly $7M in bookings through H1 beta phase, representing 50% of the overall revenue growth of the business
• These sales represent over $2.5M in recognized revenue in 2025, already matching 2024's total revenue and setting the business on a path to more than double revenue year-over-year
Together, these strategic offerings signal a critical inflection point—demonstrating how productized services and commercially-aligned innovation can unlock meaningful revenue growth, improve predictability, and strengthen long-term customer value.

Business Context: Segment Professional Services faced poor margins, inconsistent delivery practices, and a lack of customer-focused engagement. The organization had lost sight of financial fundamentals and was not structured to scale sustainably. A transformation was needed to restore profitability and realign the team to deliver measurable value to the business and its customers.

Business Risk

• Revenue carving practices significantly distorted actual profitability, masking true margin performance.
• True revenue averaged just $48/hour against a $115/hour cost basis, resulting in a -140% margin on an hourly basis
• Overall revenue versus cost showed a margin of -331%, resulting in spend more than 4x greater than revenue
• Compensation and sales policies discouraged selling services, leading to poor deal structure and under-monetization.
• Backlog-based delivery strategy created volatility, underutilized talent, and delayed revenue recognition.
To create a new trajectory for profitability in 2025, I led a comprehensive set of commercial, operational, and strategic changes.
Conclusion: This case demonstrates my ability to drive turnaround and growth by applying strategic, financial, and operational leadership. I realigned commercial levers, rebuilt delivery infrastructure, and launched scalable offerings that doubled revenue and improved margins—all while improving the customer experience.

Through operational rigor, commercial innovation, and a people-first approach, I drove measurable results while laying the foundation for sustainable growth and profitability.
