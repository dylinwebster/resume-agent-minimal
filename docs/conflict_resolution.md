# Conflict Resolution: Aligning Sales and Success at SAP Concur

## Situation
At SAP Concur, the Sales team was compensated based solely on bookings. They had the flexibility to change product mix, downgrade or terminate products, and still add others—sometimes resulting in flat or negative net revenue to the business. Despite this, the Sales team still received full quota credit and commission. Meanwhile, Customer Success Managers (CSMs) were responsible for gross revenue retention (GRR) and minimizing churn and contraction. This misalignment of incentives created tension between teams and contributed to suppressed business growth.

## Task
Identify and implement a solution that would:
- Realign sales and success incentives,
- Reverse the negative revenue impact,
- Reduce interdepartmental conflict,
- Protect business margin.

## Action
- Conducted deep discovery into sales compensation structures with a mindset of curiosity, aiming to understand their design and underlying assumptions.
- Collaborated with my ops team to build a clear and concise set of metrics illustrating how certain sales behaviors were negatively affecting long-term revenue.
- Positioned the challenge not as a sales or CS issue, but a shared business risk with consequences to growth and margin.
- Earned alignment from senior sales and CS leadership around shared objectives.
- Offered my team’s support to help sales leaders engage with the data more deeply—highlighting real-world examples of harmful selling behaviors and revenue erosion.
- Co-developed new rules of engagement (ROE) to safeguard renewals and implemented new contractual guardrails.
- Partnered to design a revised compensation plan for the following year that discouraged revenue-dilutive behaviors.

## Result
- Rolled out new ROEs and comp plan adjustments that ultimately filtered out ~10% of the sales org.
- Increased GRR and NRR by approximately 2 points YoY.
- Reduced cost of sales.
- Improved collaboration and mutual trust between CS and Sales teams.
- Created a more sustainable, growth-oriented revenue model.
