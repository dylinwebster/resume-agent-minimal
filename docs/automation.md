# Improving Automation and Efficiency in Post-Sales
# Efficiency
# AI
# Transformation

At Twilio Segment, I led a transformation to improve automation and efficiency across the global post-sales org. This included workflow automation, services tooling, onboarding playbooks, and team design.

Key outcomes:
- 19% reduction in OpEx
- 58% PS margin turnaround
- AI-driven worksflows leveraging Snowflake, Gainsight, Segment CDP, customer.io, and Slack

I partnered with systems and ops to automate routine tasks and built a team culture around efficiency metrics.
