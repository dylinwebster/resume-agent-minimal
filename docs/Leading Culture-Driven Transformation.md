Actions: Leadership Vision and Strategy

I knew the only sustainable way to dramatically improve customer retention while reducing OpEx was to rebuild the culture, realign the vision, and empower the team.

To start, I worked with my leadership team to co-create a compelling future state for Customer Success:

We articulated a new North Star focused on outcomes, trust, and partnership
We set operating principles grounded in clarity, collaboration, and accountability 
We positioned CSMs not just as support resources, but as strategic growth partners

I ensured this vision was shared broadly—not just top-down. I involved ICs in design sessions and brought Sales and Services leaders into alignment early and often.

Impact: Repositioned Customer Success as a strategic growth engine—unifying the team around a renewed mission and clarifying how we win together.

Culture Rebuild and Engagement
The real turning point came when we put the team in the driver’s seat. In my third week, I hosted a post-sales offsite with leaders from CS, Services, Support, and Ops. Through a hands-on exercise, we:

Inventoried all tasks the CSMs were performing
Mapped them by impact and effort to separate high-value work from noise 
Identified opportunities to automate, eliminate, or reassign low-value tasks

From there, we launched grassroots workstreams—voluntary, cross-functional groups tasked with redesigning our:

RACI model
CSM competency matrix
Segment-specific engagement playbooks 
Tool consolidation and automation strategy

We invited top-performing CSMs to co-lead these workstreams, creating a culture of shared ownership and pride.

Impact: Employee Net Promotor Score, or eNPS, rose from 42% to 88% in two quarters. CSMs became invested co-architects of their future, and change took hold faster as a result.

Cross-Functional Alignment and Systems Change
Driving change in Customer Success alone wouldn’t have been enough. We built tight interlocks across:

Sales: Co-owned expansion plans and renewal forecasting
Support & Services: Clarified accountability via a refreshed RACI
Operations: Launched a "One System of Record" initiative to unify tools and workflows

This cross-functional momentum helped us:

Reduce duplication and handoff friction
Improve data and account visibility for execs and ICs alike 
Standardize how we measure and manage customer health

Impact: Customer engagement became more consistent, predictable, and measurable—unlocking better forecasting and stronger partnerships across the go-to-market motion.

Leading Through Change
We faced two rounds of reductions—one in July and one in October—totaling 15% of team headcount. To maintain morale and performance:

I communicated proactively and with empathy, framing the "why" clearly 
We adjusted scaled thresholds from $100K to $150K ACV to balance loads 
We maintained service levels by reinforcing playbooks and tooling

Despite the reductions, retention improved. The team’s commitment and clarity allowed us to do more with less.

Impact: Reduced OpEx by 19% (including changes I made to remainder of my organization) without damaging customer experience. Demonstrated that disciplined execution and transparent leadershi
can coexist. 
Business Context: In early 2024, Twilio Segment was under immense pressure. Following an operational review and vocal investor scrutiny, the business faced a potential divestiture. Yet Twilio’s board doubled down, committing to improve Segment’s operating margin from -28% to breakeven by Q2 2025.

Beneath the financial headlines lay a deeper issue: organizational drift. Renewal rates had fallen to 71%, GRR was in the mid-70s, and NRR hovered around 85%. Internally, the Customer Success team had lost its way—lacking leadership, identity, and purpose. The team had not had consistent executive direction since mid-2023.
Conclusion: This wasn’t just a retention fix—it was a leadership journey. We built a culture of clarity, accountability, and ownership, and proved that Customer Success can be:

A strategic lever for growth
A catalyst for cultural change
A model of cross-functional excellence

By integrating cultural renewal with operational strategy, we achieved performance gains that exceeded expectations - and laid the foundation for durable growth.
Objective: My twofold mission was clear but aggressive:

Dramatically improve customer retention and expansion metrics (Renewal, GRR, NRR) Reduce OpEx by 19% within four quarters

To succeed, I recognized that Segment’s eroding performance was as much a people problem as a product one. Reversing the trend would require strong, empathetic leadership - driving organizational renewal from the inside out.
Outcomes: Renewal Rates: Increased from 71% to 84% (Q1 2024 to Q2 2025)

GRR: Rose from 75% to 83%

NRR: Reached 97%, with enterprise NRR at 101%

Operating Margin: Despite my organization accounting for 14% of Segment’s headcount, I contributed 32% of the OpEx reduction needed to hit breakeven

eNPS: Grew from 42% to 88%
