Company: SAP
Stage: Enterprise, Growth
Focus Area: Change Management, Operational Excellence, Revenue Retention & Expansion, Talent Development
Summary: Led a global services organization through a critical phase by restoring delivery capacity, achieving significant cost savings, and launching a new offering that generated $65M in its first year. Reduced attrition from 35% to 8%, avoided $6.5M in replacement costs, and improved operational efficiency by 40%. Implemented automation to enhance customer outcomes and reduced backlog from €84M to zero by Q4 2023.

AI Ready: Yes
Actions: Protected Revenue by Expanding Capacity Immediately

• Leveraged internal SME capacity: I pulled in premium support experts—many of whom had services backgrounds—to temporarily absorb overflow project demand.
• Activated partner ecosystem: I focused on our most strained region (EMEA), deepening engagement with top partners. I brought sales into the process, co-created enablement, and adjusted workflows to drive more partner-led implementations.

Impact: These levers cut our time-to-assign from 32 weeks to 12. While temporary, they bought us critical time to stabilize.

Address Talent Loss with a Scalable, Financially Sound Model

I quantified the revenue risk of sustained attrition and unfilled roles, then partnered with HR to redesign job families and align compensation. I pushed for two critical shifts:

• External hiring flexibility to rebuild pipeline
• A phased compensation alignment strategy, rolled out region-by-region over 8 months
Impact:

• Reduced global attrition in the services organization from 35% to 8%, equating to 119 fewer employee exits over 12 months
• Avoided approximately $6.5 million in replacement costs (119 x $55,000)
• Reduced backlog from €84M to €38.5M

Drive Margin Through Efficiency and Scaled Delivery

We completed full process mapping across our most manual roles (e.g., premium support, services) and built a business case to implement Gainsight and other AI and automation initiatives.

We designed and deployed automated workflows, onboarding journeys, and task triggers within Gainsight—replacing manual project tracking and coordination with digital playbooks and intelligent nudges.This automation framework became foundational to our scaled delivery model, allowing us to deliver consistent customer outcomes while reducing hands-on effort.
Impact:

• Internally: Increased project capacity by 20%, removed manual effort, and accelerated onboarding milestones
• For customers: Reduced time-to-value from 6 months to 45 days, with resource investment dropping from 15 to 9 hours in our most scaled motions
• Automated workflows cut onboarding effort by 40% and enabled consistent, repeatable customer experience
• Operationally: Decreased required FTE for scaled implementations from 262 to 157—a 40% efficiency gain
• Reduced backlog from €38.5M to zero by Q4 2023

Rather than backfilling all attrition, I redirected the remaining headcount to staff a new offering—Premium Assistant—which outsold our initial model by 4x. We developed talent into these roles and revisited our pricing model, aligning it to stronger-than-expected demand. In turn, this product generated $29M in ACV during the beta phase and $65M in its first year.
Business Context: At SAP Concur, I inherited the global services organization at a moment of serious risk to the business. The situation required immediate action and decisive leadership to protect revenue, stabilize operations, and restore trust.

Business Risk

• 40% attrition in key strategic regions, undermining capacity and morale
• €84M in sold projects stalled due to lack of available delivery resources, directly blocking revenue recognition
• Strict internal-only hiring policies with limited internal mobility and the lowest-paid teams across the ecosystem
• Widespread dissatisfaction stemming from global job family misalignment, leading to internal movement and external churn
These challenges posed a significant threat to our P&L and customer satisfaction. Despite leading a 750-person team, I operated within a 105,000-person company where agility was constrained. My approach focused on swift stabilization through three core strategies.
Conclusion: This case demonstrates my ability to lead with both strategic and financial precision during moments of organizational volatility. Through operational rigor, commercial innovation, and a people-first approach, I drove measurable results while laying the foundation for sustainable growth and profitability. In parallel, I embedded automation across our scaled delivery model—replacing manual processes with digital workflows and intelligent playbooks. This ensured future growth could be supported with greater consistency, efficiency, and customer value at scale.
