# Operational Clarity and GTM Alignment
# Cross-Functional Alignment
# Sales Alignment

**Theme:** Operational clarity and GTM alignment

## Situation
Post-acquisition by Twilio, roles between Sales and CS were blurry. This caused inefficiencies, inconsistent customer experiences, and churn risk.

## Task
Create a shared model to define responsibilities, improve collaboration, and build customer trust.

## Action
- Co-developed RACI models, engagement charters, and swim lanes in partnership with Sales.
- Defined clear ownership by lifecycle stage (pricing, QBRs, renewals, etc.).
- Launched joint enablement sessions across regions to reinforce alignment.

## Result
- Increased renewal forecasting accuracy and decreased last-minute risk escalations.
- Contributed to +6pt GRR improvement in 12 months.
- Drove dramatic lift in NPS (-39 to 54 pts) by improving clarity for customers on whom to engage with for what.
