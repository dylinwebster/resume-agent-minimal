**Theme:** Strategic cross-functional alignment to protect and expand revenue

**Client:** A large financial services provider (~$10B+ in annual revenue)

**Situation:**
A large financial services provider was spending nearly $10M/year with Segment. They signed largely based on roadmap promises, intending to fund their investment by retiring legacy systems like Simon Data and another major data platform.

While we successfully delivered on new features—particularly around security, privacy, and creating a zero-copy environment—we were missing key capabilities required to fully replace Simon Data. Internal product RIFs, shifting priorities, and a new focus on OneTwilio meant the client’s roadmap expectations were not being met. They were growing increasingly frustrated and considered terminating the relationship.

**Task:**
Stabilize the relationship, regain customer trust, and deliver on prioritized roadmap items while aligning internal teams to preserve the account.

**Actions:**

- Met directly with the COO of the client organization to assess expectations, build rapport, and clarify how they defined success.
- Learned that while expectations hadn’t been met, the COO was pragmatic and willing to engage if communication and accountability improved.
- Internally realigned stakeholders across Product, Engineering, and CS to focus only on the highest-priority features tied to revenue-generating use cases.
- Gained internal commitments to realistic timelines and kept the customer engaged with transparent updates.
- Delivered a coordinated roadmap narrative and backed it with targeted professional services to accelerate adoption.

**Results:**

- Rebuilt trust with the executive team and power users.
- Signed an extension and prevented a potential $10M churn event.
- Preserved a high-margin account by investing ~$200K in professional services to unlock value.
- Achieved alignment between CS, Sales, and Product around a unified success plan.
