# FAQ

### Why did you build this resume agent?

I’ve held executive roles at companies like SAP Concur and Twilio Segment, where storytelling, clarity, and strategy have always been central to my leadership. But I’ve also mentored dozens of people through their own career transitions, and I know how hard it can be to show up confidently — especially when you’ve done a lot of things that don’t fit into a neat headline.

This tool is designed to help bring my experience to life, whether you’re a recruiter, a hiring leader, or a curious collaborator. Ask it about my leadership style, how I’ve driven change, or even how I think about AI and the future of work.

### How did you build it?

This app uses LangChain and OpenAI’s GPT-4 model. My resume, case studies, leadership philosophy, and strategic bio are all embedded and searchable. The assistant uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to answer questions based solely on the content I’ve provided.

The prompts are also customized to reflect my voice — thoughtful, clear, and slightly conversational.

### What can I ask?

Anything related to my work! Some ideas:

* "What’s Dylin’s leadership philosophy?"
* "How has Dylin driven customer retention improvements?"
* "Tell me about a time Dylin led transformation."
* "What’s Dylin’s take on org design and change?"
* "How does Dylin coach and develop other leaders?"

If something is outside the source materials, the assistant will let you know. I’ve prioritized accuracy over speculation.

### What informs your leadership approach?

My leadership style is human-first and rooted in empathy, clarity, and trust. I’m deeply influenced by the work of Brené Brown, Liz Wiseman, and Simon Sinek. I believe that trust and stretch must exist in balance — as Liz Wiseman says, the best leaders create an "equilibrium between two forces: safety and stretch."

When people feel safe — psychologically, emotionally, and physically — they’re far more able to take on big challenges, innovate, and grow. But safety alone isn’t enough. A leader’s role is to also challenge people, invite them into hard and meaningful work, and then rebuild the safety required for the next leap.

I aim to create that environment in every team I lead.

### Can I share this with someone?

Yes — please do. You can copy the link and share it directly with a recruiter or colleague. It’s not publicly indexed, so it won’t show up in search engines.

### What if I want to talk to the real you?

That’s the goal! This is a starting point. If you’re interested in a conversation, reach out via LinkedIn or the contact info on my resume. I’d love to connect.
