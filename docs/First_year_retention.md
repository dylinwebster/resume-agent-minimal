## Situation
When I joined SAP Concur, the Customer Success team was energetic but lacked a defined charter—operating more like an extension of support. I led the team through a CX maturity model transformation: implemented Gainsight, built engagement playbooks, created foundational data models, and improved visibility and retention. Roughly 18 months into the role, with CS operating more maturely, I broadened my focus and discovered a systemic issue: over 50% of our churn came from customers in their first year.

## Task
The early journey was fragmented and unowned. Sales reps—comped on new revenue—retained accounts 3–12 months post-sale, customers lacked CSM coverage, and implementation services were spread across 3–5 individuals, none accountable for long-term retention. The task was to reduce first-year churn and improve continuity across the customer experience—without waiting for a full re-architecture of the lifecycle or expanding the cost base significantly.

## Action
I built a business case and presented to our President: visualizing the customer journey, highlighting KPI misalignment, and connecting churn directly to process design. I requested $1M to fund a new pilot team of CSMs focused solely on first-year accounts. Then, I began cross-functional alignment—collaborating with Sales, Services, and Marketing to gain buy-in. I identified points of resistance, especially in Services, and worked closely with leadership to design handoffs, escalation plays, and a “shared wins” approach. My team built Gainsight-based scorecards and workflows to operationalize lifecycle transitions and risk detection.

## Result
- $12M in revenue saved in year one.
- 25% improvement in retention among first-year customers within six months.
- Increased Sales productivity through earlier handoff of post-sale work.
- Used pilot to secure momentum for broader CX redesign across Sales, CS, Services, and Product.
- Laid the foundation for a fully integrated, customer-centric journey once I assumed global responsibility for services.
