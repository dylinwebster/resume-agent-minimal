# Retention as a Revenue Lever

At Twilio Segment, we improved gross revenue retention by revamping how we onboarded and engaged customers. I introduced standardized customer journeys, defined lifecycle signals using CDP data, and trained CSMs to focus on driving business outcomes—not just activities.

This helped reduce churn, expand customer value, and improve predictability of renewals—key levers to protect margin and fuel net growth.
