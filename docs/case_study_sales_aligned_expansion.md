# Case Study: Driving Sales-Aligned Expansion Growth Through Customer Success

## Background
At both SAP Concur and Twilio Segment, I identified a common gap: Customer Success Managers (CSMs) were seen primarily as renewal shepherds rather than commercial partners. While they had deep account knowledge and influence, their activities weren’t systematically driving expansion pipeline. Sales teams, meanwhile, were focused on new logo acquisition, leaving upsell potential underdeveloped.

## Objective
- Transform CSMs into commercially-minded growth partners without compromising their customer advocacy role.
- Increase expansion pipeline generation, improve forecast accuracy, and accelerate close rates on upsell opportunities.

## Approach

### 1) Build a Shared Account Growth Framework
- Implemented **TRUE Account Scoring** (Timing, Relationship, Use case expansion, Executive sponsorship) to prioritize accounts most likely to expand.
- Jointly reviewed scores in **monthly pipeline councils** with Sales, CSM leadership, and Solution Architects.
- Aligned coverage so CSMs owned expansion opportunity identification and early-stage engagement, while AEs took deals through contracting.

### 2) Sales Methodology Enablement for CSMs
- Adapted **SPIN Selling** and light Challenger techniques for a post-sales context, enabling CSMs to uncover latent needs in business reviews.
- Created playbooks with discovery questions, expansion triggers, and positioning templates tied to product modules and value narratives.
- Delivered enablement via role-play workshops, pairing CSMs and AEs to practice opportunity handoffs.

### 3) Operationalize and Measure
- Embedded expansion opportunity logging in Salesforce with stage-specific definitions to ensure consistent reporting.
- Tied CSM KPIs to both expansion pipeline sourced and influenced revenue, with recognition programs for top contributors.
- Ran quarterly win/loss analysis on CSM-sourced deals to refine approach.

## Impact
- **SAP Concur**: CSMs drove **80% of expansion pipeline** and **50% of closed expansion revenue** within 12 months of program launch. Resulted in **2% ARR uplift** year-over-year in enterprise segment.
- **Twilio Segment**: Achieved **100% enterprise account plan coverage** in one quarter, improved forecasting accuracy, and reduced “surprise churn” from 35% to 8%, enabling more proactive expansion plays.
- Increased average expansion deal size by **22%** in target accounts.
- Strengthened CS–Sales partnership, creating a predictable, repeatable motion for upsell identification.

## Conclusion
By fusing proven sales methodologies with Customer Success relationship depth, I created a revenue engine within post-sales that consistently delivered measurable growth. This initiative demonstrated that CSMs, when empowered with the right tools, training, and alignment, can be among the most effective pipeline generators in the business.
