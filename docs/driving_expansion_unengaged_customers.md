**Theme:** Unlocking growth through customer engagement insights and CSM-led expansion

## Introduction
During the post-pandemic slowdown from 2019–2021, SAP Concur experienced stagnant growth despite strong renewal rates. With GRR lagging and contraction increasing, we had to identify new ways to stimulate recovery and fuel growth toward the $1B target.

## Situation
As a travel-dependent SaaS business, our GRR was constrained during the pandemic. Sales pipeline slowed, and many customers were disengaged—no contact with CS, no sales engagement, no event or marketing participation.

## Task
Find untapped revenue sources and reduce contraction by identifying and re-engaging dormant accounts. Empower CSMs to target disengaged customers despite high ratios (often >160:1) and limited bandwidth.

## Action
- Conducted segmentation analysis to correlate customer engagement with GRR and NRR.
- Identified clear thresholds of interaction (marketing, CS, sales) that drove stronger retention and growth.
- Flagged accounts with zero engagement activity in the prior year.
- Built reporting dashboards to expose disengaged accounts to CSMs.
- Created playbooks for stakeholder mapping, multithreading, and outreach campaigns.
- Focused CSM efforts on “disengaged” cohort, driving proactive outreach and use case discovery.

## Results
- Increased customer engagement reach by 19%.
- Converted dormant customers into active champions through targeted re-engagement.
- Unlocked 2% ARR uplift directly attributable to the campaign.
- Provided a scalable, high-leverage play that supported a broader revenue recovery trajectory.

This initiative helped turn a challenging period into a strategic inflection point for revenue reacceleration.
