## SAP Concur: Customer Success Qualified Leads (CSQLs)

**SITUATION:**  
Operating in a high-volume business environment, SAP Concur needed a consistent pipeline of new leads. CSMs were often closest to existing customers and in a position to surface potential growth opportunities.

**RESULT:**  
- CSMs generated 50% of closed-won expansion pipeline, reaching 80% in some segments.
- CSM-driven re-engagement efforts led to a 2% increase in ARR.
