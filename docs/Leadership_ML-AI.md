# STAR Example: Visionary Leadership & Technical Growth — Building ML-Enabled Customer Intelligence at Twilio Segment

## Summary
Led the strategy and foundational architecture for a next-gen customer health model that combined telemetry, onboarding, and business outcomes data—evolving from strategic data leader to one capable of activating AI through agentic systems.

## Situation
After stabilizing GRR and rebuilding Segment’s core health scoring system, I recognized a deeper challenge: our analytics were still too static and backward-looking. While dashboards tracked outcomes, they didn’t offer the intelligence needed to proactively guide customers toward value. To scale our impact and reduce early-stage churn further, we needed a dynamic model—one that evolved with real-time behaviors and reflected customer intent and progress.

## Task
My objective was to design and architect a modern customer health system—one that integrated product telemetry, onboarding behaviors, and business outcomes into a flexible, ML-informed framework to guide intervention across CS and Services.

## Action
- I’ve always relied on data to shape strategy and drive outcomes—whether through KPIs, cohort analyses, or system-level feedback loops. But in this case, I recognized the opportunity to go further: to not only structure and model the data, but to *deploy* it in more intelligent, autonomous ways.
- I hired technical talent with predictive modeling and ML expertise and aligned them to our business outcome framework.
- We began building a health model that:
  - Pulled telemetry data into Snowflake to measure activation milestones
  - Integrated onboarding signals from Coda where we captured use-case alignment
  - Combined structured call and engagement data to predict downstream retention risk
- As the project matured, I saw that my leadership would be even more effective if I could engage directly with the *how* of activation—beyond KPIs and data architecture.
  - I learned **Python**, worked in **GitHub**, and began prototyping using **RAG architecture and LLM frameworks** to explore how intelligent agents could guide interventions, not just report on them.
  - I studied how ML models are trained, tuned, and closed-looped into operational systems, focusing on how to *activate* data—not just observe it.

## Result
- We delivered an aligned architectural model, business logic, and implementation roadmap for a dynamic health system designed to trigger smarter engagement across onboarding and CS.
- CS and Services leaders fully adopted the approach, and the org was positioned to begin piloting the system with key customer cohorts.
- **Personally, I evolved from a strategist who’s always been data-obsessed to a leader capable of shaping and deploying agentic systems—someone who understands how to translate data into intelligence that acts.**
