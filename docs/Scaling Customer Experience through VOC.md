Actions: VoC Framework Development

We established a cross-functional Voice of Customer program that unified feedback from:

• Year-one renewal trends
• NPS responses and verbatim analysis
• Customer interviews
• Internal insights from services, support, and sales
• Executive-led customer-shadowing sessions

These inputs were synthesized into a comprehensive customer journey map, which became the foundation for identifying systemic friction points and shaping targeted interventions across the lifecycle.

Lifecycle Enhancements Informed by VoC

The VoC insights we gathered also shaped how we engaged customers post-onboarding.

• Scaled touch: Launched automated, quarterly Digital Business Reviews to drive ongoing value in long-tail segments
• High touch: Repositioned QBRs as strategic planning sessions to elevate executive alignment
• Automation: Leveraged Gainsight to trigger lifecycle engagement and surface risk signals, reducing manual effort and enabling proactive outreach.

These changes allowed us to tailor experiences by segment while improving operational efficiency.
