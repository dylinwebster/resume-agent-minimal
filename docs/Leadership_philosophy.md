# Leadership Philosophy

I lead with clarity, curiosity, and accountability — and I believe that to lead well is to be deeply human. To be a leader is to be grounded in who we are as people, and to lead from that place with purpose and intention. The most effective leaders aren’t removed from the people they serve; they’re rooted in empathy, self-awareness, and a commitment to honest connection.

At the executive level, leadership isn’t about having all the answers. It’s about creating the conditions for better decisions, faster learning, and lasting impact. That starts with defining success clearly — not just in revenue terms, but in how teams collaborate, grow, and support one another through change.

I believe in structured thinking and shared language that help teams align and stay focused. Whether I’m shaping a customer strategy or mentoring a new manager, I aim to create clarity in complexity. I’ve trained leaders using models like Multipliers and am influenced by voices like Liz Wiseman, Simon Sinek, and Brené Brown — whose work reminds me that trust, courage, and curiosity are the bedrock of strong leadership.

I coach emerging leaders to begin their journey by knowing who they are. I often use a values-based reflection exercise — helping people surface what truly motivates them, who inspires them, and how they want to show up for others. From there, we build leadership habits rooted in their values, using situational coaching, developmental feedback, and a strong sense of personal accountability.

At SAP Concur, I launched “Project Lead the Way,” a program designed to develop future leaders from within. We created intentional pathways for high-potential ICs, pairing them with mentors and giving them real-world scenarios to practice leadership skills like coaching, feedback, and decision-making. It became a core part of our culture and pipeline — and it worked, because it was personal.

I believe in operational rigor, not rigidity. Great teams thrive on clear roles, thoughtful rhythms, and a deep culture of talent development. I set high expectations, but always pair them with context, support, and a belief in people’s capacity to rise.

Feedback, to me, is a form of care — a principle reinforced by Kim Scott’s *Radical Candor* and Brené Brown’s insight that “clear is kind.” I lead with transparency and expect the same in return. When people know where they stand, they grow — and so do their teams.

As Brené Brown says, “Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity, and change.” That belief has carried me through every stage of transformation I’ve led. When trust and empathy are present, change becomes possible — not just in systems, but in people. And that’s where the real work of leadership lives.
