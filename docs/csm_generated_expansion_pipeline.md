**Theme:** CS as a Revenue Multiplier

## Situation
Expansion pipeline was underperforming. Sales was focused on net-new business, leaving cross-sell and upsell opportunities underleveraged within the base.

## Task
Equip the CS org to identify and qualify expansion opportunities, and build a structured partnership model with Sales to pursue them.

## Action
- Developed a scalable Customer Success Qualified Lead (CSQL) process with clear criteria and attribution models.
- Partnered with Sales leadership on a joint engagement plan; embedded expansion goals into CS KPIs.
- Trained CS leaders on light SPIN selling and how to ask discovery questions during strategic check-ins.
- Created account health segmentation framework called TRUE: Terminating, Risk, Unengaged, Engaged.
- Sales prioritized "Engaged" and "Unengaged".
- CS focused on "Risk" and "Unengaged" with programs to map stakeholders and re-engage key personas.

## Result
- CSMs sourced ~80% of expansion pipeline and contributed to ~50% of closed expansion revenue.
- Re-engaged 19% of dormant customers, generating 2% ARR uplift.
- Built mutual trust and increased coordination across CS and Sales teams.
